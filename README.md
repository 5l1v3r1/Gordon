Ever wanted to get yelled at by Chef Ramsay whenever you inevitably fuck up
your script or make a typo on the command line? Well now you can. 

*Introducing: **Gordon for OS X**, the command line tool that will make you 
feel like a fucking donkey because you can't spell the command `quit` correctly.*

## Installation
Screaming and swearing is just around the corner, just follow these simple steps:

* Download all the insults from the `insults` directory
* Place the contents of `gordon.sh` into your `~/.bash_profile`
* Set the `GORDON_INSULTS` variable to the directory where you saved your insults
* Install CoreUtils on mac to install gshuf utility. You can use homebrew and run: `brew install coreutils`

That's it! Try messing up on the command line, and enjoy Chef Ramsay's insults.
I even added a nifty little test script for you called `test.py`.
